publication materials for RAD walleye decision support tool

The main file here 'app_FME_Submission.R' is an R scirpt used to run the shiny app. The app is the decision support tool that was delivered to Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to assist in walleye management decision making. 
The data input files are not proved here but may be made available upon request (contact Colin Dassow colin.dassow@wisconsin.gov). 
The data inputs are described in the script to provide the reader with an idea of what data types are used in the tool.
